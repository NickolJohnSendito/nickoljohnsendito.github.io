            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I was born in a simple town in Brooke's Point, I am the eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. Eduardo Sendito. 
            When I was a child I was always present in every activities and included in the
            top students that rached the highest grades in our school. I was a happy and very energetic kid but one day
            everything has changed when I became a victim of bullying. 
    
            <br>
    
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            After those hardships, my life has changed. I became a prisoner of my hatred and vengence. I wanted to make them feel 
            what I felt when they were bullying and embarrassing me in front of many people. So on that day I decided to changed my personality
            and the way I dreased the same as how they look and behave.

          <p class="third"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              This is me when I was in high school, probably a grade 10 student. Through all the 
              hardships that I faced because of bullying then suddenly my parents got separated too
              and at that very moment I realized that my life has ruined. I started to join gangs
              and groups that are popular trying to find my place and the love that I am longing. 
              I also engaged in various vices, met new friends and stopped studying several times, those
              actions made my life and my relationship to my family more complicated.

          <p class="fourth">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

              But when I Entered Senior High School and transfered to other school I've became separated with my peer group
              and also became friends with other people who has a better outlook towards life.

        <p class="fifth">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I realized my mistakes then and all the sacrifices that my parents did to me so to make up with them I 
            tried to study hard and be with my new friends who are serious on finishing their studies. 
            My friends introduced me to God and I realized that everybody is equal in the eyes of the Lord and
            at that very moment I became confident of who I am.

        <p class="sixth">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

           I let God enter my life and it feels great. I thought no one ever wanted to listen to my problems, but God is 
           always there to save me, to lift me up to the burdens that I cary and to be with me through good days and bad.

        <p class="eigth">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

           Even if my parents cannot afford to make me study in college I still find ways so that I could continue to study again.
           I worked on my uncles restaurant to support my financials and applied to the university as a student aide.
           Life is so hard when you dont have diploma these days and now I had many dreams to fulfill.

      <p class="seventh">And then I met her again</p>

        <p class="eigth">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

           The girl that I've been praying to God for so long, the girl who made a huge impact
           on my life in making me realize the right and wrong, the girl who love me for who I am before 
           has returned into my life again. And right at this moment I will never ever 
           waste the time and the opportunities that God gave me and embrace all the blessings that I have including her.
           Now I have many reasons to live and I am always grateful because I have them in my life.
